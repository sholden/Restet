This is currently a very basic way to expose PDFlib TET cli functions.  

Right now, I only need a small subset of features, but as I need more I will implement additional
extraction parameters and resources.

TET can be found here: http://www.pdflib.com/products/tet/

I think this is the greatest OSS project known to man.
